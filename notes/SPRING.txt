framework that help build java applicaiton
provides a large number of helper and annotaitons

but it's hard to configure

so we use SPRING BOOT
-perform auto-configuration based on prop files (properties file, store configuration data or settings)
     and JAR (zip files that include the project and the server) classpath
-help to resolve dependency conflict
-provide embeded http server

spring boot applicaitons can be run in the command-line or from my IDE
