tool that help the dev by downloading the jar files that we need

how it works?
-MAven read the config file for the JAR files that I put in there
-check in my local repo if I already have them, if not it will download them from remote repo and save them
-then will build and run them

MVNW file
allows the dev to run the Maven project, without have install MAven in the pc
to use it wrote the commande ./mvnw clean compile test
